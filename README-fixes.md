# Campus Link Application - Issue Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Club Creation and RLS Policy Issues
- **Problem**: RLS policy violation when creating clubs; missing `create_club_with_admin` function
- **Solution**:
  - Completely rewrote the `createClub` function in `useClubs.ts` to handle RLS errors better
  - Implemented a simpler approach for club creation instead of relying on a missing stored procedure
  - Added error handling to identify and handle different error scenarios

### 2. Icebreaker Service API Issues
- **Problem**: Hugging Face API 404 error for Llama 2 model
- **Solution**:
  - Updated the API endpoint to use a publicly accessible model (facebook/opt-1.3b)
  - Implemented better error handling with timeouts
  - Added more robust fallback responses when the API fails

### 3. Database Schema and Missing Columns
- **Problem**: Missing columns like `banner_url` and `logo_url` in the clubs table
- **Solution**:
  - Created a migration script to add missing columns to the clubs table
  - Fixed the ClubDetailPage query to remove references to non-existent columns
  - Created a storage bucket for club images with proper RLS policies
  - Implemented a workaround using localStorage for storing logos when database columns aren't available

### 4. Profile Embeddings and Personality Data Errors
- **Problem**: Errors when querying non-existent tables like `profile_embeddings` and `personality_traits`
- **Solution**:
  - Completely rewrote the functions to safely check for table existence
  - Implemented fallback behavior when tables don't exist
  - Added robust error handling to prevent app crashes

### 5. Club Image Upload and Storage
- **Problem**: Errors when uploading club logos due to missing storage bucket
- **Solution**:
  - Added bucket existence check before attempting uploads
  - Created a migration to add the required storage bucket with proper permissions
  - Added graceful error handling for failed uploads
  - Implemented a localStorage-based fallback for storing and retrieving logos

## Additional Improvements

1. Better error messages and user feedback through toast notifications
2. Improved club sharing functionality with copyable links and join codes
3. Enhanced ClubCard component to display club logos from multiple sources
4. Added validation for file uploads (type and size)
5. Added a random join code generator for private clubs

## Installation and Usage

### Database Migration
Execute the SQL migration files to add the missing columns and create the storage bucket:
```sql
-- From database/migrations/add_clubs_logo_url_field.sql
-- From database/migrations/create_update_club_logo_function.sql
```

### Application Updates
The fixes are implemented directly in the application code and should work once the database migrations are applied.

## Known Limitations
- Some features may still require additional database configuration
- The workaround for club logos using localStorage is temporary until proper database support is added
